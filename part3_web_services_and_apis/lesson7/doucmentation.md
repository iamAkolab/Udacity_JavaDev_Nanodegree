Itâ€™s very important to document your REST APIs. There could be other developers that need to use your APIs or you may have customers that want to use your APIs to help speed up their development time.

Documentation is a good way to communicate to others how they can use your APIs. Documentation communicates the operations available, the format for requesting data and the format data will be returned in.

Typically, the initial creation of documentation is easy, but the on-going maintenance of keeping that documentation up to date is hard. Imagine having to manually update documentation every time your code changes! It's good to use tools that automatically inspect your code and update the documentation.
