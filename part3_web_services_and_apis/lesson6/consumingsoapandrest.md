# Consuming REST

There are times when you want to consume (or call) publicly accessible web services or APIs in your application. If there is a web service or API available that provides the data you need, it doesnâ€™t make sense for you to build one from scratch. This allows you to deliver your products and services faster to your end users.

[RestTemplate](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/RestTemplate.html) allows you to consume a REST API programmatically from your code.
