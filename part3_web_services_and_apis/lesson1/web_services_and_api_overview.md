# Web Services.
## What is a Web Service?.
A web service is a way to share data between two disparate systems. The communication typically happens between a client and a server.
* Client - The client makes a request for data.
* Server - The server responds to the client's request.

## Web Service Communication
The means of communication between the client and server is via a standard web protocol like HTTP (or HTTPS) on the world wide web, that uses a common language like JSON or XML.

A client invokes a web service by sending an XML (or JSON) message, then waits for a corresponding XML response from the server.

## How Web Services Work
* Step 1: The web service provider (the person who created the web service) defines a standard format for requests and also for the responses provided.
* Step 2: The client sends a request to the web service across the network.
* Step 3: The web service receives the request and performs an action (like query a database or perform a calculation) and sends a response back to the calling client.

# Benefits of Web Services
The concepts of reusability and usability allow organizations to use web services provided by third parties. This reduces development time and delivers more powerful applications.

# Web Services vs APIs vs Microservices

While APIs and Webs Services are the communication interface for different architecture styles, microservices is a distinctive method to develop software systems that have well-defined interfaces and operability.
One of the most obvious differences is that web services, unlike APIs, require a network to function. APIs can function online or offline.

Furthermore, web services are not protocol-agnostic like APIs. APIs can use any design style or protocol, but web services are restricted mostly to SOAP or Simple Object Access Protocol.

## Publicly Accessible API

All web services are APIs but not all web APIs are web services.
