# Introduction
## Project Introduction
In this project, you'll use your skills with Spring Boot, APIs, documentation, and testing to implement a Vehicles API that serves as an endpoint to track vehicle inventory. While the primary Vehicles API will perform [CRUD operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) (Create, Read, Update and Delete) related to vehicle details like make, model, color, etc., it will need to consume data from other APIs as well regarding location and pricing data. You will implement a RESTful API for the Vehicles API, as well as converting a Pricing Service API to a microservice.

By the end of this project, you'll have an application that can communicate with other services and be able to be viewed and used through Swagger-based API documentation.

Over the next several pages, we'll do a brief overview of the code for each application involved in the project, and then the instructions for the project itself. You are welcome to skip the code overview sections if you want to dive straight into the project instructions. You can download the project code from the [Github repo](https://github.com/udacity/nd035-C2-Web-Services-and-APIs-Exercises-and-Project-Starter), and go to the P02-VehiclesAPI folder.

# Location Service Code (Boogle Maps)
You'll find the code related to our location service in the boogle-maps folder. It serves as a Mock to simulate a Maps WebService where, given a latitude and longitude, will return a random address.

You won't have to implement anything as part of this application, but let's take a quick look through the included files. Note that every package is within com.udacity, so we won't include that part of the package name below.
## Address
This declares the Address class, primarily just made of the private variables address, city, state and zip. Note that the latitude and longitude are not stored here - they come from the Vehicles API.

## BoogleMapsApplication
This launches Boogle Maps as a Spring Boot application.

## MapsController
This is our actual REST controller for the application. This implements what a GET request will respond with - in our case, since it is a Mock of a WebService, we are just responding with a random address from the repository.

## MockAddressRepository
Repositories normally provide some type of data persistence while the web service runs. In this case, this Mock is simply choosing a random address from the ADDRESSES array defined in the file.

# Pricing Service Code
You'll find the code related to our oricing service in the pricing-service folder. It serves as a REST WebService that simulates a backend to store and retrieve the price of a given vehicle. In the project, you will convert it to be a microservice registered through a Eureka server.

Let's take a quick look through the included files, only certain files of which you will need to implement. Note that every package is within com.udacity, so we won't include that part of the package name below.

pricing
## PricingServiceApplication
This launches the Pricing Service as a Spring Boot application.

pricing.api
## PricingController
This is our actual REST controller for the application. This implements what a GET request will respond with - in this case, a randomly generated price gathered from the PricingService. Once converted to a microservice, the Controller should not be explicitly necessary.

pricing.domain.price
## Price
This declares the Price class, primarily just made of the private variables currency, price and vehicleId.

## PriceRepository
This repository provide a type of data persistence while the web service runs, namely the ID->price pairing generated by the PricingService.

pricing.service
## PriceException
This creates a PriceException that can be thrown when an issue arises in the PricingService.

## PricingService
The Pricing Service does most of the legwork of the code. Here, it creates a mapping of random prices to IDs, as well as the method (in our mock service here) to generate the random prices. Once converted to a microservice, the Service should not be explicitly necessary.
