# Lesson Outline
* Testing with JUnit: We introduce JUnit, the standard testing and assertion framework for Java. We learn how to write new tests and check out assumptions by using JUnit's extensive library of assertion methods.
* JUnit in Situ: We look at how we can use IntelliJ (or any other IDE) to run tests, debug errors, and get reports about code coverage.
* Selenium/WebDriver: We introduce Selenium, a tool for browser automation, through its Java API, selenium-java. We look at how to write Selenium scripts to simulate user actions in a browser at a high level.
* JUnit and Selenium: We discuss how to use Selenium's java API inside of JUnit tests, which opens the door to an advanced technique: automated user testing.
