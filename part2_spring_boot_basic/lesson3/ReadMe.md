# Lesson Outline
* Spring IoC Configuration: We discuss the basic mechanism at the core of Spring, Inversion of Control, and how to configure it for our applications.
* Spring Components and Services: We introduce a mental model for developing with Spring, built around classes that we define called components and services.
* Server-Wide Configuration: We learn how to configure certain server-wide properties of a Spring Boot application.
* XML-Based Configuration: We discuss an older form of Spring configuration, still in use, that uses XML files to define dependencies, server-wide options, and more.
