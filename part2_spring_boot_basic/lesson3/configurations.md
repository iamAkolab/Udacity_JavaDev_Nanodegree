# Server-Wide Configuration

Spring Boot does a lot to simplify the setup of a new Spring application, but sometimes, you need to change how it works. 
That's what the application.properties file is for! You can find it in the src/main/resources folder of a generated Spring 
Boot project, and it allows you to configure anything from the server's hostname and port to the size and colors of the Spring 
logo that appears in the console when starting an application.

# Key Terms
