# Lesson Outline.,
* ORM is the Norm: We introduce ORM, or object-relational-mapping, a software pattern that leverages the similarities between Java classes and SQL tables to eliminate boilerplate in data access code.
* MyBatis Mappers: We introduce MyBatis, a dead-simple ORM tool for Java that integrates well with Spring. We discuss the "Mapper" classes MyBatis wants us to design to access the database.
* Practical Example - User Credentials and Authentication: As a motivating example for using ORM, we discuss how to implement basic login security with a User table, MyBatis, and Spring Security. We walk through a lengthy sample project that implements the entirety of this motivating example.
