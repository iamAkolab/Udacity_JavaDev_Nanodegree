# The Structure of this Course and the Dependencies between Lessons



## Course Outline
Basics of Java server architecture, dependency management in Java, and how Spring integrates with both.
Core Spring principles. We'll be covering dependency injection, bean configuration, service development, and server-wide configuration.
Spring MVC and Thymeleaf, an HTML template engine. We'll talk about Spring controllers, Thymeleaf template attributes, and connecting the two with the MVC pattern.
Connecting your Spring app to a database and securing it with Spring Security. We'll cover the basics of ORM and MyBatis, an ORM tool for Java. We'll use the database to store user credentials securely and use them to authenticate users with Spring Security.
Testing and web browser automation with Selenium. We'll cover how to set up and run tests with JUnit, how a web driver works, and how to simulate user actions in the browser with Selenium. We'll also discuss page objects, Selenium's powerful abstraction tool.
