# PART 05: SECURITY ABD DEVOPS
In this course, you will learn about the technologies involved in the ”Security” and ”DevOps” of a Java-based enterprise application development. By the end of this course, you will be able to...

- Implement authentication and authorization on a Spring Boot application using JSON Web Token (JWT)
- Unit test the Spring application using ”JUnit” and ”Mockito” frameworks
- Use SLF4J logging API and Log4J logging framework for code insight and debugging the application
- Use the ”Splunk” tool for analyzing machine-generated raw data
- Set up a ”CI/CD” pipeline, that will connect and automate the deployment of your code present in Github to the server running on the cloud.

Also, we will introduce an “eCommerce application” that you will work through and submit as your final project.

Module 01: Security and DevOps

- Lesson 01: Authentication and Authorization: Implement authentication on a Spring Boot application using a JSON Web token.
Lesson 02: Testing: Learn fundamental concepts of testing. Learn how to set, write and run tests using Junit, the most popular Java Unit Testing Framework and Mockito.
- Logging: Learn how to use logging to get better insights into your code and debug your applications more easily. Get practice with two commonly used logging utilities: SLF4J and Log4J.
Lesson 04: Splunk: Splunk was founded in 2003 to make sense of machine-generated data. Here you’ll learn about what Splunk can be used for, how to install it, and how to use it for generating dashboards and more.
Lesson 05: CI/CD : You’ll learn about various CI/CD tools including git, docker, Jenkins, and more and how to use them to setup a pipeline on an AWS instance.
Lesson 06: eCommerce Application
