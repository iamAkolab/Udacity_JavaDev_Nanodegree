## Note about JPA rebranding
JPA changed names in 2018 when Java EE was rebranded to Jakarta EE in an effort to separate the Enterprise Edition development from ongoing trademark issues surrounding the term Java in their framework name. Java EE, or Jakarta EE now, fills a similar role to Spring in that it provides a large number of tools to enable enterprise-scale projects. One of those tools is JPA, now Jakarta Persistence API (but, conveniently, still the same letters). Just something to keep in mind when searching for more info.
