# Big-O Notation
| Notation | Name   | Example   |
| :---:    | :---:  | :---:     |
|    O(1)  | Constant time  | Int a = 1 + 5   |
| O(n)     | Linear         | Search in an unsorted array. |
| O(logn)  | Logarithmic    | Binary search  |
| O(nlogn) | Linearithmic   | Quick sort, merge sort, heap sort. |
| O(n^2)   | quadratic      | Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort. Literate through an 2D-array. |
| O(c^n)   | Exponential    | Dynamic programming. |
| O(n!)    | Factorial      | Permutation, dynamic programming |
