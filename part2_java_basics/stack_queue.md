# Stack and Queue
Stack follows last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle. That’s when you add an element, you add that to the top, when you remove an element, 
you also remove it from the top. Similar to the two methods what we just learned from LinkedList, offerFirst, and removeFirst, which are 
equivalent to Stack’s push and pop.

On the other hand, Queue follows first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle. An excellent example of a queue is a line of customers waiting to 
buy ice cream. The first customer will get the ice cream first, and when they get the ice cream, they will leave the queue. Similar to 
two methods we learned from LinkedList, offerLast, and removeFirst, which are equivalent to Queue’s enqueue, and dequeue.
